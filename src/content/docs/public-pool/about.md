Public Pool is fully open source, solo Bitcoin mining pool. There is an official instance of the pool available at [web.public-pool.io](https://web.public-pool.io), where you can point your miners, but you also have the option to [host it yourself](./selfhost.md).

The official instance is managed by [Ben](https://github.com/benjamin-wilson). The backend runs on hardware under his physical control, and only the GUI relies on cloud infrastructure. Public Pool was developed from scratch with the goal of offering easy installation, a modern interface, maintainability, and low complexity.

The repository includes both the stratum server and the GUI. Contributions are welcome.
