# Bitcrane

## What is this?

Introducing the Bitcrane. A tool to spit bytes at an Antminer hashboard over USB (and control fans & PSU).

The Bitcrane is useful for exploring and developing alternative Antminer firmware. It is not a drop-in controlboard replacement. The Bitcrane can be used with mining applications like [piaxe-miner](https://github.com/shufps/piaxe-miner) running on a PC or RPi, or you can write your own firmware in the language of your choice.
